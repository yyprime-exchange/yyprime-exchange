## Purpose

Serum trading strategies to provide liquidity within EMA-defined bands

1. Serum trading bots that implement a specific strategy (i.e â€œprovide liquidity 5% above and below the 30 minute moving average")

1. Users would have the ability to deposit funds into the protocol, choosing from a few reasonable choices of parameters (EMA length, market depth, etc.)

1. The strategy would ideally reference Pyth Network for pricing

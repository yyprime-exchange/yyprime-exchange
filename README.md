## Purpose

Serum trading strategies to provide liquidity within EMA-defined bands

1. Serum trading bots that implement a specific strategy (i.e â€œprovide liquidity 5% above and below the 30 minute moving average")

1. Users would have the ability to deposit funds into the protocol, choosing from a few reasonable choices of parameters (EMA length, market depth, etc.)

1. The strategy would ideally reference Pyth Network for pricing

1. Solana is likely the only blockchain robust enough to support orderbooks.
